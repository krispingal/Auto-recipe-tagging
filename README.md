Good food is born after many experimentation. This repository contains some of the experiments 
I conducted to understand some of the magic behind good food.

Food recipes were obtained by scraping the site [epicurious.com][epicurious] which is a great site to explore food 
recipes. Next I try to generate some of the 10 most common tags for recipes, which turns out to be :

1. Peanut Free : 16554
2. Soy Free : 16119
3. Bon App√©tit : 15524
4. Tree Nut Free : 14046
5. Vegetarian : 13557
6. Kosher : 12532
7. Pescatarian : 12301
8. Gourmet : 11158
9. Quick & Easy : 9635
10. Wheat/Gluten-Free : 9616

I used [NB-SVM][nbsvm] to solve this multilabel problem with 10 classes and got a ROC-AUC score of 0.788.
