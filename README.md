Good food is born after many experimentation. This repository contains some of the experiments 
I conducted to understand some of the magic behind good food.

Food recipes were obtained by scraping the site [epicurious.com][epicurious] which is a great site to explore food 
recipes. Next I try to generate some of the six most common tags for recipes, which turns out to be :

1. Peanut Free 
2. Soy Free
3. Bon App√©tit
4. Tree Nut Free
5. Vegetarian
6. Kosher
